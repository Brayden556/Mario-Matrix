// Sprite format rules:
// - Use 8×8 arrays per frame (SMW-style building blocks)
// - Use palette index values (same palette as world sprites in MarioMatrix_ESPS3.ino)
// - Store arrays in PROGMEM

// --- Ground Enemies ---
// Goomba, Koopa, Spiny (walking ground enemies)
// (place future 8×8 arrays here)
